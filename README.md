# calcite-ui-icons
A collection of UI SVG icons created by Esri for applications.

## Installation

`npm install git@github.com:ArcGIS/calcite-ui-icons-public.git --save`

## Description
Icons come in two styles:
* **filled** 
* **outlined**

and 3 sizes:
* **16x16**
* **24x24**
* **32x32**

### Why 3 Sizes?
More info on what happens when you scale vector based icons [here](https://github.com/ArcGIS/calcite-ui-icons-public/wiki/What-Happens-When-You-Scale-Vector-Based-Icons)

### Outline icons are the standard
Outline icons have the default name. For eample, `trash-16.svg` will render the default outline icon. 

If needed, appending `-f` (`trash-16-f.svg`) will render the filled version.

**Outline icons should be the primary icons to be used.**

### Sprite packages
Furtheremore, sprites are available in 6 packages and live ouside the `icons/` directory:
* sprite-16.svg
* sprite-16-f.svg
* sprite-24.svg
* sprite-24-f.svg
* sprite-32.svg
* sprite-32-f.svg

Filenames that contain `-f` contain filled icons only. <br>
Icons in the sprite have an `id` of the individual SVG file name. 

### Individual icons structure
All the individual SVG icons have a common file structure:
This is what the `close-16.svg` looks like:
```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 16 16">
  <path d="M0 10V7h10.965l-5-5H9.5L16 8.5 9.5 15H5.964l5-5H0z"/>
</svg>
```

None of the icons have `stroke` attributes. The `fill` attribute can be defined with css:

```
svg {
  fill: gray;
}
```

All the other styling properties applicable to the whole svg element are applicable.
```
svg:hover {
  fill: blue;
}
```
